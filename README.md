# Cricket Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project analyzes Champions Trophy 2025 match data to extract meaningful insights about teams, players, and venues. It involves data exploration, match-level analysis, team performance evaluation, player performance analysis.

## Steps Performed

### 1. Importing Libraries and Dataset
- Loaded necessary Python libraries.
- Imported the cricket dataset for analysis.

- Checked dataset information using `.info()`, `.shape()`, and `.columns()`.
- Identified duplicate values and handled them accordingly.

### 3. Match Level Analysis
- Calculated total runs scored by each team per match.
- Identified the minimum and maximum runs scored in a match.
- Computed the average score for each venue.

- Determined the highest individual score in a match.
- Calculated the strike rates of batsmen.
- Found the highest wicket-taker.
- Analyzed bowlers with the best economy rates.

### 6. Visualizations
- Bar chart for the top 10 batsmen.
- Bar chart for the top 10 bowlers.
- Heatmap showing over-wise runs distribution.
- Box plot to compare venue-wise runs.
- Line graph showing trends in run rate over different overs.

## Technologies Used
